# ETS2Controler-Arduino-Leonardo

This code is made for ETS2 controler with parts of real cars. If you want to use this code in your hardware, you have to make a pinmap and set pins where they should be.
I made this code and hardware with the parts those are in Tuxcan ix since 2010 of Hyundai. I refered to the pinmap of each part, and made the map of connection with arduino and connector of the parts.

## Make a PINMAP

If you want to see the pinmap of the part you have, you can see that in google.

I got the map in [GSW(Global Service Way - Technical Information)](gsw.hyundai.com)
